spawn a python webserver and offer it internally, this help with viewing docs in userland, since installing rust on andoid is a handfull

basically userland app has funky permission when it comes to touching the fileystem, that seems to be the status quo
for android apps. so, i can still install rust inside userland but i can offer the documentation over and internal
ip address and a python webserver. other than that im not too sure. maybe android later down the line implemnts
bsd type firewalling and then we end up having the same issues im currently dealing with when it comes to filesytems stuff
